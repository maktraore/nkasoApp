Reservation web app and Admin page

In this project I am planning to create a web app for a company that rent apartment for short terms and does money transfer business (RIA, WU, Orange Money and Sama Money). The name of the Application is: NkasoApp
This web app will have two components:
1.	A main page where clients can make reservations as guest and 
2.	An admin page where admin can enter data about the business operations, see reservations and see statistics of business operations. 
3.	The app will have a main page, a profile page for each room, admin page, sign up /login for admins page, add/edit room page, add/edit transfer operations pages, add/edit mobile operations pages, new/edit reservation page.							
Main page:
1.	There will be photo links to each apartment’s profile where they can book by filling out a form. 
2.	It will list services available, marketing information and rules.
3.	Clients can make also reservations from here by filling out a form without going to apartment profile. 
4.	There will be admin sign section at the right top corner of the main page where admin can sign in.

Admin page will have 4 sections:
1.	Apartments statistics section where admin can see daily, weekly, monthly and yearly statistics by apartment.
2.	Transfer operations statistics
3.	Reservations page where admin can perform CRUD Operations on reservations
4.	Data entry. Admin will be able to manually put the money transfer operations done during the day but can’t edit or delete.
5.	Add rooms

Clients will be able to:
1.	They can search by type and/or name of apartment on the main page.
2.	They can click on my reservations on the main page and put their phone number and the reservation confirmation number they were sent after their booking. 
3.	They would be able to edit or delete their own booking (Only the status will change in the database). 
4.	They don’t need an account

Super Admin or Owner would be able to:
1.	Perform CRUD on admins account.
2.	Add/update/delete a hotel
3.	Can do/see anything Admin can do/see
